# Getting started

## exploiting the device
I'm using DELL XPS15 running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.  
When I used [palera1n](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n) and followed [this guide](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-palera1n/?tab=linux#running-palera1n-1) directly from my computer it doesn't work (I think some problem with the usb driver while the device connected my machine recognised that as a camera ).   
I got the error:
```bash
Timed out waiting for download mode (error code: -status_exploit_timeout_error)
```
no one on the discord really helped me so i moved on and burn on Disk On Key image of [palen1x](https://github.com/palera1n/palen1x/releases/download/1.1.10-1/c-palen1x-v1.0.10-2-amd64.iso) which running some version of debian.  
```bash
sudo umount /dev/sda1
sudo dd if=c-palen1x-v1.0.10-2-amd64.iso of=/dev/sda1 bs=8M status=progress
```
after boot-up my machine to the Live-CD and ran the the exploit and it works perfect!  

setup a password for the ssh and got ssh conenction directly to my exploited iPhone.
```bash
ssh mobile@{your_phone_ip}
```

## iBoot

* Some article about leak of iBoot:

* extract SecureRom using pcie inject thechnique (expensive and time consuming)
	* the best way today to inject pcie is to use pcieleech

the *Phone has diffrent PID (Product ID) in normal mode and in Recovery Mode:

```bash 
sudo palera1n -E
